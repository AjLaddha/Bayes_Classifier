# Bayes_Classifier
We need to design classifiers considering varying constraints on covariance matrices of all
classes resulting to four distinct cases. For every case we consider each dataset separately.
For each point in each test dataset, our classifier predicts the class it belongs to. The results
of this classification for each dataset is presented in the form of a confusion matrix which is
further analyzed in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure.
